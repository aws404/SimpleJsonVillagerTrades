# Datapacks
This directory contains various data packs which can be installed in conjunction with SJVT to add pre-defined trades.
If a pack requests TK (Translation Keys), it also needs to be installed as a resource pack to support these, or you can install the sever translations mod to force the keys by the server (https://github.com/arthurbambou/Server-Translations).

| Pack Name | Description | Req. TK |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| super_cartographers | Adds explorer maps for many vanilla structures to the cartographers trade pool, including mineshafts, igloos, pyramid and neighbouring villages. | yes |
